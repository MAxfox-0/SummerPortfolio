        <h1><spam>Why Did I Choose These Components</span></h1>
        <p>I chose the 4080 super and 7800x3D because I wanted to play at 1440p ultra settings. To play at those settings I needed a very powerful GPU so I went with Nvidia's second-best GPU so I could max out the settings and future-proof the PC. I was aware that a high-end CPU is necessary to prevent a bottleneck, so after doing a lot of research I landed on a chip with low power draw and incredible performance, but despite only having 8 cors because of the 3D V-Cache the 7800x3D is one of
            the best consumer-grade CPUs</p>

                <p>If you are wondering what 3D V-Cache is, it's a new technolagy AMD developed that stacks the chases vertically increasing the prossesing speed but keeping the die size the same the increased cache size means the chip will not have to store data in much slower system memory or even worse an SSD</p>

                <p>The reason I bout a Nvidia card insted of one from AMD is because of AI upscaling. This tecnolagy is for games and it improves the performance by 30% to 50% for a smal percent of computing power. Nvidia's verson is called DLSS Deep Learning Super Sampling. it looks at the frames getting upscaled and in a process theat compines information from the game engen alongside its own analassis of the upscaled frames making the game run smother and look beter.</p>
